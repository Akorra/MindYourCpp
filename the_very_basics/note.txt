# Legacy Constructs
## Casting
  int i = (int) 4.9; is the same as int i = static_cast<int>(4.9);

## Macros
  #define Pi 3.14 -> substitutes Pi for 3.14
  const double Pi = 3.14 better in c++
  #define SQR(x) (x*x) -> old style inlining gets SQR(1+1) wrong -> better to use functions

## C Style arrays
  int numbers[4];
  int numbers[] = {1,2,3,4};
  -> doesnt know how long it is

## C Style strings
  c style array of characters
  terminated by '\0' signal
  std::string can construct char*string

## Pointers
    int* pi // pi is pointer to integer
    int j=4; pi = &j; // address of j
    *pi = 3; // changes j's value, changes what is pointed by pi (which is an address)
