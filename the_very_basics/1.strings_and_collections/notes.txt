# Strings and Collections

## Objects and Classes
 - C++ is an object oriented language.
 - A class defines the idea of an object (what information it holds and what can it be asked to perform)
 - An object is an instance of a Class.
 - Member Functions -> function in a class.

## Strings
 - String class in std namespace (#include <string>).
 - Compare/Combine/Manipulate/Search/replace/(...) Strings.
 - For unicode use 'wsatring'.

## String Manipulation
### Operators
    + -> combine strings.
    == < > != -> test 2 strings
### Member Functions
    - length
    - substr
    - find
    ...

### Collections
    - When we need to work with a number of similar items
    - Simplest and best first choice: vector (holds a number of same type values,
                                              size does not need to be known in advance,
                                              easy to access a specific or all items).
#### Vector
    - push_back(item) -> append item
    - insert(item) -> moves items around (use only if needed)
    - types must match
    - begin(vec) and end(vec) -> pointers to first and last element.
    - algorithms lib -> sort() and count();
    - string is also a collection.

### Behind more curtains
    - Operator overloading gives intuitive ways to use objects.
