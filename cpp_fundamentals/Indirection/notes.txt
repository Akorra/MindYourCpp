# Indirection
## Pointers and References
 - References
  - Can only set target when declaring it
  - All other actions go through the reference
  - Cannot be made to refer to something else
 - Pointer
  - Can point to something
  - Can point to "nowhere"
  - Can be made to point to something else
  - example:
   int* pA = &A;
   int *pA = &B;

  - to get the target a pointer points to use * operator:
    *pA = 5; -> puts 5 in address pA points to
  - example:
   Person Kate("Kate", "Gregory", 234);
   Person* pKate = &Kate;
   name = (*pKate).GetName();
   name = pKate->GetName();

  - NULL pointer => nullptr
