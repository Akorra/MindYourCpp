# Variables and Types
## Basics - Variables
  - C++ is strongly typed
  - User defined types are a thing that is suported (Struct and Class)

## Fundamental Types
  - Integers (short, long, int)
  - Real Numbers (float, double)
  - Character (char, unsigned char)
  - Booleans (true/false)

## Auto
  - asks compile rto deduce the type.
  - still strongly typed.
  - useful for ugly declarations.
