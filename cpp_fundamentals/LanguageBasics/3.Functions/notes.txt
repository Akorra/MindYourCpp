# Functions
## Free functions
  - freely usable, is not a member of a class.
  - can also take parameters by reference
    - int function(int& x)

## Member Function
  - Declare in class declaration (.h)
  - Implement in .cpp
  - in (.h) is called inline (only use if its short)
  - Mark as const unless you cant (means it doesnt change any member variables)

## Building
  - Errors can come from linker or compiler
  - Compiler error (Have you declared this function? -> making a promise)
  - Linker error (Have you implemented that function -> keeping a promise)
